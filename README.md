This package provides functionality to work with XML documents 
representing the contents of PDF documents.
These XML documents are generated by pdftohtml, specifically 
our [extended version](https://github.com/dsidavis/pdftohtml).

The functionality includes
+ parsing the document with an associated class
+ easy access to pages as if the document were a list, e.g. doc[[1]]
+ loop over the pages with lapply()/sapply()
+ extract the title of the document
+ extract the dates an academic article was submitted, revised, published
+ determine if the PDF  document was scanned
+ get the header and footer for pages
+ get the text or words for a page or entire document
+ get the text arranged by column
+ get the location for each text segment
+ get font information for each piece of text
+ display the contents of a page, including lines, rectangles, image boxes, 

## Installation

Currently, ReadPDF requires the development/Github version of the XML
package. This can be installed in R using the devtools package:

```
devtools::install_github("omegahat/XML")
```

Additionally, while the package will work with other versions of
pdftohtml, some functions will not work without our  [extended
version](https://github.com/dsidavis/pdftohtml). You can move the
binary (once built) to your system directory (e.g., `/usr/bin` on Unix
systems) or you can specify the location of this binary in R via the
env variable PDFTOHTML.
