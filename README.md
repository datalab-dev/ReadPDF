This package provides functionality to work with XML documents 
representing the contents of PDF documents.
These XML documents are generated by pdftohtml, specifically 
our [extended version](https://github.com/dsidavis/pdftohtml).

The functionality includes
+ parsing the document with an associated class
+ easy access to pages as if the document were a list, e.g. doc[[1]]
+ loop over the pages with lapply()/sapply()
+ extract the title of the document
+ extract the dates an academic article was submitted, revised, published
+ determine if the PDF  document was scanned
+ get the header and footer for pages
+ get the text or words for a page or entire document
+ get the text arranged by column
+ get the location for each text segment
+ get font information for each piece of text
+ display the contents of a page, including lines, rectangles, image boxes, 

## Installation

1. Install dev version of the XML package

Currently, ReadPDF requires the development/Github version of the XML
package. This can be installed in R using the devtools package:

```
devtools::install_github("omegahat/XML")
```

2. (Recommended) Install extended version of pdftohtml

Additionally, while the package will work with other versions of
pdftohtml, some functions will not work without our extended
version.

Clone or download [our extended version of pdftohtml](https://github.com/dsidavis/pdftohtml)

Then, build the binary executible (requires `make` and a C++ compiler),

```
cd pdftohtml
make
```

You can move the binary (once built) to your system directory (e.g., `/usr/bin` on Unix
systems),

```
cp src/pdftohtml /usr/bin
```

or you can specify the location of this binary in R via the
env variable PDFTOHTML.

```{r}
options(PDFTOHTML = "path/to/pdftohtml")
```

3. Install ReadPDF

```
devtools::install_github("dsidavis/ReadPDF")
```
