This package provides functionality to work with XML documents 
representing the contents of PDF documents.
These XML documents are generated by pdftohtml, specifically 
our [extended version](https://github.com/dsidavis/pdftohtml).

The functionality includes
+ parsing the document with an associated class
+ easy access to pages as if the document were a list, e.g. doc[[1]]
+ loop over the pages with lapply()/sapply()
+ display the contents of a page, including lines, rectangles, image boxes, 
+ extract the title of the document
+ extract the dates an academic article was submitted, revised, published
+ determine if the PDF  document was scanned
