# Finding the Abstract

Look for the "title" Abstract or Summary,
possibly with all capitals.
The text may follow this on the same line or on a line below.

The abstract may be to the right of content providing, e.g.,
metadata about the paper, e.g., publication date, accepted date, etc.

The text of the abstract may span the entire width of the page or may
be indented but spanning all columns but not to the margins.
