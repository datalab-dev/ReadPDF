In this note, we look at how we can find blocks
of lines that are related to each other and separate from
other blocks on the same page.

As an example, we'll look at
1660786150/Sun-2009-Epidemiology and phylogenetic analysi.xml

We can clearly see the
+ header
+ title
+ author names
+ author affiliations
+ dates received, accepted, published,
+ abstract
+ horizontal line
+ introduction in two columns
+ section header for "MATERIALS AND METHODS"
+ text of the section in a smaller font.

Not clearly in the image is the Corresponding author paragraph in the first column
that extends below the cropped image part.
Also, there is a page number - 2536 - on its own line as a footer.

```
doc = readPDFXML("LatestDocs/PDF/1660786150/Sun-2009-Epidemiology and phylogenetic analysi.xml")
p = doc[[1]]
```

```
bb = getBBox2(p)
ll = nodesByLine(getNodeSet(p, ".//text"))
```

```
names(ll)
```
We end with more lines than we might expect as the super scripts/footnote
identifiers in the author list are considered on lines of their own
(i.e., a line "1 2 2 2 2 2" corresponding to the line above the first line of author names).

When we get to the superscripts for the affiliations, the font is sufficiently
small so that the superscript 1 is not on its own line, but the "2" and "3" on the next line are considered on their own line.  This is controlled by a tunable parameter.


We now get the bounding boxes for the nodes in each line.
```
pos = lapply(ll, getBBox2, TRUE)
```
This is a list of data frames.

How many nodes are in each line?
```
unname(sapply(pos, nrow))
```

Looking at the value of the top, we see that the range of the difference
between the maximum and minimum top values on each line is at most 10, and overwhelmingly
0 or 1.
```
round(table(sapply(pos, function(x) diff(range(x$top))))/length(pos)*100, 3)
```

Should we use top or top + height?


Let's compute the distance between adjacent lines.
```
tp = sapply(pos, function(x) min(x$top))
diff(tp)
names(tp)[ diff(tp) > 20 ]
```

However, we want to take into account the size of font for each line.
Of course, each line may have multiple fonts and different sizes.

```
fi = getFontInfo(doc)
ll.fonts = lapply(ll, function(x) table(sapply(x, xmlGetAttr, "font")))
lapply(ll.fonts, function(x) fi[names(x), "size"])
```


Let's look at the abstract.
These are lines 17 through 30.

The interline-skip for these lines is 
```
diff(sapply(pos[17:30], function(x) min(x$top)))
```
and all have a value of 15.

All text segments in these lines have font size 11: 
```
unique(sapply(ll.fonts[17:30], function(x) unique(fi[names(x), "size"])))
```

So the gap between the tops is 15 and the height of each line is 12
```
unique(sapply(pos[17:30], function(x) unique(x$height)))
```
and the font size is 11.

Since we know these are contiguous lines, this gives us a sense of how far
a gap between lines should be.


Now let's consider the lineskip between the line above the abstract, i.e.,
```
Received 6 February 2009/Returned for modification 25 May 2009/Accepted 7 June 2009
```
We know these are further apart.

```
sapply(pos[16:17], function(x) min(x$top))
             Received 6 February 2009/Returned for modification 25 May 2009/Accepted 7 June 2009 
                                                                                             332 
In 2004 and 2005, an epidemiological survey of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was 
                                                                                             364 
```

The gap is 
```
diff(sapply(pos[16:17], function(x) min(x$top)))
In 2004 and 2005, an epidemiological survey of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was 
                                                                                              32 
```
The height of each line is 11 and 12 respectively.
<!--
sapply(pos[16:17], function(x) x$height)
-->
And the  font sizes are
```
lapply(ll.fonts[16:17], function(x) fi[names(x), "size"])
$`Received 6 February 2009/Returned for modification 25 May 2009/Accepted 7 June 2009`
[1] 10

$`In 2004 and 2005, an epidemiological survey of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was`
[1] 11
```
So the interlineskip of 32 is almost the height of 3 lines, and twice the interlineskip of 15
for each pair of lines in the abstract.


Now let's compare the the within-line skip of the institutional information and the Received line:
```
table(diff(sapply(pos[10:16], function(x) min(x$top))))

 2 13 15 29 
 1  2  2  1 
```
We see the gap of 29 between the last line of the institutions and the Received line.
The within-group lineskips are 2 to 15. The gap of 2 is due to the superscripts.

We can check the font information for these lines to ensure that the fonts are not atypically large:
```
table(unlist(lapply(ll.fonts[10:16], function(x) fi[names(x), "size"])))
```
```
 6 10 11 
 3  1  5 
```


Now let's look at the blocks above this:
```
names(ll)[3:9]

                        Epidemiology and Phylogenetic Analysis of Crimean-Congo 
                                                                             45

                                                                    1 2 2 2 2 2 
                                                                             31

                                                                              3 
                                                                        1 3 4 2 
                                                                             16 
                Fuchun Zhang, Changshou Hang, Zhihong Hu, * and Yujiang Zhang * 
                                                                              3 
```

Now we need to compare the font sizes for these lines
```
lapply(ll.fonts[3:9], function(x) fi[names(x), "size"])
$`Copyright Â© 2009, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.`
[1] 10

$`Epidemiology and Phylogenetic Analysis of Crimean-Congo`
[1] 22

$`Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses in Xinjiang, China`
[1] 22

$`1 2 2 2 2 2`
[1] 8

$`Surong Sun, Xiang Dai, Muhetaer Aishan, Xinhui Wang, Weiwei Meng, Conghui Feng,`
[1] 14

$`1 3 4 2`
[1] 8

$`Fuchun Zhang, Changshou Hang, Zhihong Hu, * and Yujiang Zhang *`
[1] 14
```
We have the interlineskips between successive pairs of lines.
The gap between "Copyright..." and "Epidemiology..." is 45.
The font sizes are 10 and 22. So 45 is more than 2 times the greatest font size of the two.

For the next pair of lines, "Epidemiology ... " and "Hemorrhagic...", the gap is 27
and both lines have font sizes of 22. So our rule would correctly associate these lines together.


The superscripts make up the next line. We have a gap of 31 between these and the previous line (Hemorrhagic..)
If we correctly connect these to the next line and ignore their heights, we would end up with a minimum gap of 34
between "Hemorrhagic...." and "Surong Sun...".



And, the gap between "Sciences, Wuhan..." and "Received 6 February" is 27.
The maximum font size for each ine is 11 and 10.  So again, the gap is more than twice the maximum font size
and indicates separate blocks.


There is a horizontal line in the middle of the page:
```
getBBox(getNodeSet(p, ".//line | .//rect"))
          x0      y0      x1      y1
line 200.498 584.611 675.998 584.611
line  64.748 979.111 145.748 979.111
```
The first separates the abstract from the regular text of the document
