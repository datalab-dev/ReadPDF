# Finding the Abstract

Look for the "title" Abstract or Summary,
possibly with all capitals.
The text may follow this on the same line or on a line below.

The abstract may be to the right of content providing, e.g.,
metadata about the paper, e.g., publication date, accepted date, etc.

The text of the abstract may span the entire width of the page or may
be indented but spanning all columns but not to the margins.


Look at the font for the abstract text and use that to know where we end.
And a larger interlineskip between lines to indicate the start of a new section even if there is no section header.
 e.g. LatestDocs/PDF/1609915988/McIntosh-1976-Culex (Eumelanomyia) rubinotus T.xml




For some documents, e.g. Weaver-2001,
the abstract is a centered rectangle of text  with
larger margins than the rest of the doument.
In other words, the text starts and ends at approximately the same location
on each of the lines, but there is extra space before and after each line.
One way we can identify this is
```
doc = readPDFXML("LatestDocs/PDF/3602790318/Weaver-2001-Extreme genetic diversity among Pi.xml")
g = getPageGroups(doc[[1]], 14)
t(sapply(g, margins))
```
```
  [,1] [,2]
1   76  464
2   81  827
3   91  818
4   78  831
5  130  778
6   76  833
7   77  463
```

We can see that item 5 has a larger first value and a smaller second value.
The first and last rows correspond to header and footer text which do not span the page.

We can compare these to the overall page margins:
```
margins(doc[[1]])
```
```
[1]  76 833
```
All but the 5th row above are close to 76.
The 3rd row corresponds to the block of text listing the author names.
This too is indented a little. It might be a candidate for an abstract.
However, we can look at its lines via g[[3]].
This is a list with 4 elements. The names of the elements give the text
for each line.
Each element itself is a list with one or more nodes, i.e., they are grouped by line.
We can calcuate the margins of each line:
```
lapply(g[[3]], margins)
```
```
$`Scott C. Weaver,* ,1 Rosa Alba Salas, Nuris de Manzione, Charles F. Fulhorst,* Amelia P. A. Travasos da Rosa,*`
[1]  91 818

$`, Â¶ Â¶`
[1] 270 635

$`Gloria Duno, Â§ Antonio Utrera,Â§ James N. Mills, Thomas G. Ksiazek, Duilia Tovar,`
[1] 181 727

$`Hilda Guzman,* Wenli Kang,* and Robert B. Tesh*`
[1] 293 615
```
The second "line" corresponds to superscripts (connecting the author to an affiliation listed later).
If we had used a different interline-skip to group the lines, this could have been absorbed into the line for which it is a superscript.

We see from these margins that the lines do not start at the same horizontal position.
They are in fact centered.

Compare this with the lines in our would-be abstract:
```
t(sapply(unname(g[[5]]), margins))
```
```
      [,1] [,2]
 [1,]  142  778
 [2,]  130  777
 [3,]  130  777
 [4,]  130  777
 [5,]  130  777
 [6,]  130  777
 [7,]  130  777
 [8,]  130  777
 [9,]  130  777
[10,]  130  777
[11,]  130  777
[12,]  130  694
```
All but the first line starts at 130.  This first line is slightly indented corresponding to the first line of
a paragraph.
All the lines end at the same horizontal position (+1); the final line is shorter.

So the 5th block looks like an abstract.
