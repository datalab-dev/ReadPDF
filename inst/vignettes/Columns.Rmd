# Detecting Columns

Many journal articles use two or three columns on each page.
However, there are also many that have a single column of text.
And often the abstract, or some other section of text,
is formatted with a single column, while the rest of the page(s)
is multi-column.

The function getColPositions() is a generic function
that attempts to determine the number of columns.


```
sot = readPDFXML("LatestDocs/PDF/1573445118/Sotomayor-Bonilla et al_2014_Short Report Deng.xml")
```
We start with a page and get the nodes
```r
tnodes = getNodeSet(sot[[1]], ".//text")
```
Next we group these by lines.
```
ll = nodesByLine(tnodes)
```
This is a little more flexible than just matching the top attribute of each node.
It allows the top attributes to be different by a small amount based on the
most commonly occuring font in the document (based on number of characters).

We might like to think that the number of elements in each element of `ll`
is the number of columns. In other words, that if there are two columns
there are two text nodes, with one for each column.
However, a single contiguous text segment on the page may be divided
into multiple nodes because of changes in font or color or other reasons within the PDF structure.

Next we compute the start and end positions of each node within each "line" of nodes:
```
le = lapply(ll, getLineEnds)
```
Each element of `le` is a matrix giving us the left- and right-most extents of
each element.

Let's look at the 15th element. We happen to know that this is the line that contains
the word "Abstract":
```r
grep("Abstract", sapply(ll, xmlValue))
```

```r
le[[15]]
```
```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  136  188
[2,]  203  822
```
This shows there is a separate of 15 horizontal units between the two line segments.
Now let's compare that with the the next line:
```r
le[[16]]
```
```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  123  822
```
This is a single line segment.

However, the 20-th element has 6 components:
```r
le[[20]]
```
```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  123  242
[2,]  241  294
[3,]  298  362
[4,]  362  585
[5,]  589  653
[6,]  653  822
```
This corresponds to the line 
```r
xmlValue(ll[[20]])
```
```
[1] "Artibeus jamaicensis"                  ", and one"                             "A. lituratus"                          ") and two bats in Montes Azules (both"
[5] "A. lituratus"                          "). No effect of anthropogenic"
```
Let's compute the between-node distance:
```
x = le[[20]]
x[-1, 1] - x[-nrow(x),2]
```
These values are all small: -1, 4, and 0.

Next, let's look at the 25-th element of `le`:
```
le[[25]]
```
```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  109  454
[2,]  490  849
```
We can see that there is a "gap" of 36 units between the two segments.

Let's look at the next 20 elements. We'll use the
function `interNodeDist()` to compute the maximum distance between
the nodes:
```
unname(sapply(le[26:45], function(x) interNodeDist(, x)))
 [1] 35 35 35  0 35 36  0 35 35  0 35 36  0 35 35  0 36 35 35 36
```
We see a consistent 35 or 36 unit distance, except when there are 0 values.
These 0 values occur typically when there is only one node on this line.
In these cases, these correspond to lines where we have a sole superscript node:
```r
ll[26:45][which(unname(sapply(le[26:45], function(x) interNodeDist(, x))) == 0)]
```
This indicates that we need to split the lines more precisely to include the 
superscripts on the line on which they occur, or alternatively,
ignore/discard these superscript nodes.
Ignoring or discarding them will add to the "between-node" distance.
However, it is unlikely to be significant.

We can ignore these line elements
+ being a single text node
+ determining their extent to be a small proportion of the page width.
Alternatively, we can have `interNodeDist()` return a `NA` value.

We adjust the `interNodeDist()` function to return `NA` for single nodes.
So now we query the inter-node distance with
```
na.omit(unname(sapply(le[26:45], function(x) interNodeDist(, x))))
```
```
[1] 35 35 35 35 36 35 35 35 36 35 35 36 35 35 36
attr(,"na.action")
[1]  4  7 10 13 16
attr(,"class")
[1] "omit"
```

There are 70 lines  in `ll`. What about all of these from 26 onwards
```
na.omit(unname(sapply(le[26:70], function(x) interNodeDist(, x))))
```
```
[1]  35  35  35  35  36  35  35  35  36  35  35  36  35  35  36  35  35  36  36  49  35  35  35  36  35  36 154  36  36  35  36  35 388  35 174
```
We see very large values: 154, 388 and 174.

The lines these come from are
```
unname(sapply(ll[26:70][is.na((sapply(le[26:70], function(x) interNodeDist(, x))))], function(x) paste(xmlValue(x), collapse = " ")))
```
```
 [1] "14"                                                                    
 [2] "15"                                                                    
 [3] "2"                                                                     
 [4] "16"                                                                    
 [5] "3"                                                                     
 [6] "17"                                                                    
 [7] "transitional zone between primary forest and agricultural/"            
 [8] "livestock areas or human settlements. In both regions, the sites"      
 [9] "3000, Colonia Ciudad Universitaria, MeÂ´xico, Distrito Federal, Mexico"
[10] "129"   
```

The 2, 16, 3, 17 are superscripts.
The 129 is the page number at the bottom of the page.
The 'transitional zone...' and
'livestock...' are consecutive lines in the second column.
There is a gap in the first column at that vertical position.
The gap precedes the Address for the author.
The '3000, Colonia...' element is in the address and while
it visually aligns with text in the second column, it is technically
on a different line as it has a different top and bottom since it is
rendered in a different smaller font.


We can query the elements for which the gap is greater than 40:
```r
p = sapply(le[26:70], function(x) interNodeDist(, x))
names(le[26:70][!is.na(p) & p > 40])
```
```
[1] "a different mosquito species or cross-reaction with antibodies In this study, samples were collected from bats trapped in"
[2] "in DENV transmission remains unknown. changes using RT-PCR. Bats were collected in Montes Azules"                         
[3] "* were located at least 20 km from significant human populations"                                                         
[4] "03310. E-mail: chuchomayor16@gmail.com and BenemeÂ´rito de la AmeÂ´ricas in Chiapas State). Bats were"                    
```
The first corresponds to a gap of 54 and corresponds to a regular line
in the first column and an line in the second column that starts a
paragraph with an indentation.

The 'in DENV ...' corresponds to a line in the first column that ends a paragraph
and is shorter than the other lines in that column. The associated line
in the second column starts at the usual position for that column.

The '* were located' text corresponds  to the first line in the Address 
text of the first column, and the line in the second column at the same vertical position.
However, the * is slightly higher than the 'Address correspondence...' 
and is considered to be on a line by itself. This is again
due to the way we segmented the lines and the smaller font in this Address text.
We probably want to discard this text under the line at the bottom of the 
first column's regular text.
The line and the smaller font suggests this.

The final text - '03310. E-mail:...' also corresponds to a short line in the first column
ending a paragraph.


Let's look at the lines ll[1:24], i.e. that appear before the start
of the regular text.
