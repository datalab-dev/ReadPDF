# Find the Sections


Currently, getSectionText()/findSectionHeaders() finds
the sections and returns their text.
However, this ignores the text before any starting header.

So we will adapt getSectionText() to have an option that 
collects not just the sections in the paper, but also
the 
+ title
+ abstract
+ author list
+ affiliations
+ sections


Additionally, we will attempt to find the tables and make them separate sections
(or perhaps insert them within the section that refers to each table).



We can use getDocTitle() and getDocTitleString() to get the title.

findAbstract() attempts to find the abstract.
